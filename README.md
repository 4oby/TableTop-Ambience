# TableTop-Ambience
As a DM I often lost a ton of time preparing for the sessions.
It involved searching ambient sounds, set them ready, yada-yada-yada...

I did use a bunch of tools like:

http://rpg.ambient-mixer.com/dungeon-for-pathfinder
http://www.bluefacegames.com/dmdj/

The are nice tools, but none of them did WHAT and HOW I wanted.

This is a mere attempt to realize just that.
